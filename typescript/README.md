### Liskov substitution Principle

### Dependency inversion Principle
- Dependency inversion is not just dependency injection
- High level modules should not depend on low level modules but both should depend on abstraction
- Classes or modules should depend on abstraction instead of concrete implmentations.
- source code dependencies refer only to abstractions, not to concretions.
- Abstractions == interfaces, abstract classes.
- Reduce changes to interfaces
- it is the volatile concrete elements of our system that we want to avoid depending on.
